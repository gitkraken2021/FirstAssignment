 3. Create a directory with **your** **name** (ex:FirstAssignment/anand) in Local WorkSpace
 
      a. Add a test file into the directory (ex: FirstAssignment/anand/testfile.txt)
      
      b. Check git status
      
      c. Add the directory to the Staging Environment (use git add <filename/directory> / git add ./ git add <filenames> / git add filename with regular_expression/wildcard )
      
      c. Commit the directory to Local Repo with **proper description** (git commit -m "Give proper description")
